## Aaron's Capstone
=========================

### Project Overview  
The Problem area:	
What are the chances of going pro in mens indoor volleyball if you're from the US.	
My project address the questions what features or attributes are predictive of an amateur volleyball player going pro? Are
physical attributes the most predictive, or are club or college of origin more important?
	

The User:
The people who would want to know the anwser to this question are, aspiring younger players who want to know their chances based on their perfomances and genetics.
Also coaches for NCAA teams, as well as professional clubs hoping to recruit players out of college,
This project would help these individuals know what their chances are and dictate how much harder they need to work in order to beats the odds, or help a player who's on the fence about whether or not they'll be able to make it make a decision. 
This project will also help coaches and recruiters know who to look for based on desirable qualities that that team might be looking for. 

The Big Idea:
The plan is to make a model based on several different features. Mainly physical attributes such as height, weight, vertical. It also aims to seperate each of these attributes by postition to help differentiate desirable attributes per position.

The Impact:
I anticipate this project  will be valuable to athletes hoping to go pro from a young age decide whether or not they think they can go pro and if they should train for it or not. I imagine this will help motivate players that might not meet the normal genetic average train harder and focus more on volleyball.
This also may persuade players who don’t think they have what it takes to make it in volleyball pursue a different sport or hobby saving time and potential heartbreak.
I anticipate that this will also help coaches save time and money by focusing on top prospects and those most likely to succeed.

Where the data is coming from:
https://volleybox.net/players/US
Data set of professional volleyball players and their teams, as well as position, individual height, vertical reach, and where they're from. Has some missing entries but a ton of data.
https://volleybox.net/clubs
includes list of professional teams outside of the US as well as rosters.
https://www.ncaa.com/rankings/volleyball-men/nc/nc-mens-volleyball-rpi
Data set of NCAA D1 mens volleyball teams, I plan to take roster data from each school individually from 10ish years and see who went pro vs who didn’t. Includes position, height, vertical reach.
